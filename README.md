Project: This project is a game manegment system that displays games in a main game library with a short description, image, and title of the game. 
You have the option to add the game to your personal library where you can store the game for whatever reason you would like
In both libraries the user has the option to sort the games by their genre
Once a game is in the personal library the add button turns into a remove button that once pressed will remove the game from the personal library.

This app is designed for gamers who want an easier way to organize their game libraries and discover their favorite titles. Whether youâ€™re struggling 
to sort through a growing collection or deciding which games to prioritize, this app helps you filter and manage your games seamlessly.
